protonet
========
ProtoNet is a barebonese C# Neural Network designed to be an example of backpropagation.

Where's the code?
========
ProtoNet will be uploaded tonight (at which point I'll update my readme!) I am working out some bugs, but wanted to
psych myself up with a github repo :)

I'm trying to make the code as readable and well-documented as possible, enabling people to easily understand and learn
how to implement their own backpropagation networks. After spending a "casual" year trying to make sense of the algorithm,
something clicked for me. I wish to share this knowledge with others, hopefully saving someone a year of pondering!
